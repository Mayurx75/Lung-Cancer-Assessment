# 🫁 Lung Cancer Risk Assessment

This project is a machine learning model designed to assess the risk of lung cancer based on input features such as smoking habits, age, and other medical factors. 

## 🚀 Live Demo
Check out the live demo: [Lung Cancer Risk Assessment](https://lungcancerriskassessment.netlify.app/) 

## 📌 Features
- Predicts the likelihood of lung cancer based on input symptoms and habits.
- Uses a trained machine learning model for accurate risk assessment.
- Simple and user-friendly interface for input and results display.

## 🛠️ Installation
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lung-cancer-predictor.git
cd lung-cancer-predictor
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ▶️ Usage
Run the Streamlit or Django-based web application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
*(Modify the command if using Django or another framework.)*
